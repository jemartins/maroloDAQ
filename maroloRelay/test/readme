Relay SIMPL softwareIC.

There are 3 processes involved in this demo of the relay IC.
	relay - the main relay process
	relayStim - the process which sends to relay
	rly_receiverSim - the process which receives the message

======================================
How to run relay unit testing.
======================================

You will need one console logged onto 

	$SIMPL_HOME/softwareICs/relay/test

for this test.

You will need to run the startup script:

	gorelay

This will startup the following processes:
	fclogger - trace logger
	relay
	rly_receiverSim
	relayStim

You can terminate this script with a <ctrl C> or by entering "q" at the
-> relayStim prompt.

At the -> relayStim prompt you can try entering the following 
-> ?   - this will display all the relayStim UI options
-> t hi - this will send this message to the relay and on to the recvr 
-> q - this will cause the relayStim to terminate gently

NOTE:
The trace logger output is being routed to file
	$SIMPL_HOME/bin/junk
